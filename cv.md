## Skills

* Ruby since 2004 as the main language; a lot of non-Rails experiences (Sinatra and Grape-based microservices, tools, and gems);
* Rails since 2016, including participation in architecture for large Rails apps with DDD-like decoupling;
* Huge fan of BDD with RSpec and documenting the code, developed tools for both;
* Main development interests: tools for developers, information extraction, wrapping external libraries and APIs;
* Other languages: deep, yet outdated, C++ knowledge; wrote some production code in Python, PHP, VBA (for Excel, don't laugh); had a hand or at least curious eye on tens of others; lately, some Rust;
* Storage technologies: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, Mongo, ElasticSearch, a bit of Cassandra;
* No fear of database design, normalization, and denormalization (and making decisions between them), though, far from DBA level;
* Have done a lot of things with AMQP (RabbitMQ);
* Some experience (including practical) with Semantic Web technologies: RDF, SPARQL, Virtuoso;
* Very outdated experience with neural networks;
* Solid knowledge in basic client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, XML/XSL/xPath), regular understanding of HTTP protocol and so on;
* A bit weak on devops side, though not afraid of bash, docker, Capistrano, heroku and stuff;
* Standard knowledge of Linux command-line, git, and other default tools;
* Fluent, though not always ideal, spoken and written English (worked in a multilingual environment and gave successful talks on international conferences).
* Master degree in Computer Science ([KNURE](http://nure.ua/en/)-2004).
