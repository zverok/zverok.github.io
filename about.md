I am Victor Shepelev (aka "zverok"), software architect and poet/fiction writer.

I was living in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and work for [Hubstaff](https://hubstaff.com). Since Mar 2023, I am serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces amidst [Russian full-scale invasion](https://war.ukraine.ua/).

I started to program in 8th grade (the year was 1997). At first, I wrote in Borland/Turbo Pascal, then Delphi, then C++, then, after many adventures, found Ruby (the year was 2004 or 2005). Since then, it has been my primary programming language, and I am a Ruby committer, mostly dedicating my efforts towards the expressiveness of the language and its core documentation.

I am interested in the evolution of programming languages and follow the history of ideas of many of them, both mainstream and obscure. I occasionally worked as a tech journalist/columnist in 2000s. Now I am writing for myself.

I have written fiction/poetry since I learned to write. As of 2024, I have one published novel in Ukrainian, and one finished yet unpublished novel in English that I am not ashamed of.
