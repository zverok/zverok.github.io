Hi. This is a development/IT/open-source related personal site of Victor Shepelev (aka "zverok"), developer and writer. [More about me →](/about.html)

I write [in Ruby](/public.html), and [about Ruby](/blog/), and [contribute](https://github.com/zverok/my-ruby-contributions) to Ruby language development and documenting. Lately I also started to write some Python for linguistics and open data-releated projects.

> Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zverok), via [RSS](/feed.xml) to this site, or **[subscribe](/subscribe.html)** to my mailing list.
