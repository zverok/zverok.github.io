Here are (semi)random notes, trying to outline a system of views on
controversional "monkey-patching" topic—the views I myself consider sane
and reasonable. It may seem other way for you, but it could be a start
for rational discussion.

## Monkey-what?..

In below text, we'll use term "monkey patch" for changing behavior of some Ruby
classes and modules you haven't written, whether it be core classes, or
standard library ones, or classes of third-party library, gem, framework.

> Fun fact I can't validate: "monkey patch" ← "gorilla patch" ← "guerilla
  patch". This theory of etimology is reasonable, but for me it looks more
  like an "urban myth" (or backwards ethymology).

At good ol' days, an ability to "patch" any class and library behavior was
considered Ruby's strength, but lately (and I mean, like, "5+ years"
lately) it was more and more "considered harmful" by thought leaders.

But let's take it slowly.

### Why do we monkey-patch?

**_Some (real and artificial) examples._**

**1. To have "more pretty/natural/readable" code**

```ruby
five_days_ahead = Time.now + 60 * 60 * 24 * 5   # Fooooo
five_days_ahead = Time.now + 5.days             # Cool!
```

The (well-known) ActiveSupport's code above requires just defining some
methods in Ruby's `Numeric` class, like `day`/`days`, and voila! You,
kinda, have your code as close to just saying "5 days" as it is possible
staying inside Ruby.

**2. To interweave existing and new code**

ActiveSupport's example above also requires patching `Time` class:
`5.days` statement, in fact, returns instance of `ActiveSupport::Duration`
(which allows pretty `#inspect` and other goodies), but Ruby's `Time`
doesn't give a damn about `ActiveSupport::Duration`. So, we just do
more patches! We replace `Time#+` and `Time#-` with our own versions,
which are ActiveSupport-aware (with fallback to "native" version, so
we still can do just `Time.now + 30`).

So, once you start trying to be "natural" and intervene some core structures
with your own cool additions, you eventually find yourself "fixing" the
entire language here and there, bless Ruby for allowing it.

**3. To fix something we consider broken**

That is mostly related to third-party libraries, not Ruby core classes
or stdlib itself. You need to get your things done, you have some class
or module that behaves wrong (bug) or "wrong" (incovenient to you), you
read the source, then redefine one or two methods in your own code, and
you are good.

Until the next version of a patched library, of course.

**4. To place behavior where it belongs**

Like in a definition of object, you know? "Object = data + behavior".
Ruby's _almost_ pure object-orientedness, concise syntax and praising of
method chains often make us to want even more "concise and readable"
things, adding new and new methods to core classes (numbers, strings,
collections).

Unlike `#days` above, here we are talking about methods that actually
relevant to object's context and responsibilities, not just an attempt
to make funny syntax.

Some examples:

* `Number#clamp(min, max)`—returns number which is definitely between `min`
  and `max`, e.g.

  ```ruby
  -1.clamp(0, 10) #=> 0
  100.clamp(0, 10) # => 10
  5.clamp(0, 10) # => 5
  ```

  When you have large formula or set of formulae,
  with several times said `return 0 if x < 0`, you'll appreciate this
  a lot (BTW, [already accepted](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10594)
  as a Ruby standard feature);
* `String#surround(before, after)`—while developing something heavily
  dependent on constructing strings from strings from strings, you'll
  be happy with `"foo".surround('(', ')') # => "(foo)"`;
* `Array#sum` (nothing to explain here; BTW, also accepted in core for
  Ruby 2.4).

To be honest, that's the best and, when used right, incredibly helpful
usage for open classes: when moving towards that best mix of OO and
functional we are all looking for currently, ability to do
`the_value.something_reasonable` is a real gift from heavens. Sometimes.

## Cool, then why monkey-patching is a questionable practice?

**Patches are global, unstoppable, often unexpected and hard to detect.**

You just `require` someone else's code (it even can be yours, you just
forgot about global effect of changes), and, next second:

* your code becames incredibly slow (because you rely on math, and
  somebody redefined `Fixnum#+` to allow it being summed up with custom
  classes);
* your duck typing breaks (because somebody loved to do "smart trick"
  and add `String#to_a`, and all your `if arg.respond_to?(:to_a)` became
  false positives);
* screwed up in any other way.

There are even more problems, typically associated with monkey patching, less
severe yet still pretty ugly:

* patches conflict: if you are developing in conditions where every other
  library relies on monkey patching, earlier or later you'll came to
  situation when there are two samely named methods from different sources
  with slightly or absolutely different behavior; one of libraries could
  be broken;
* scope pollution: eventually you have hundreds of methods defined on each
  and every object; that's not _that_ bad on its own, but leads to harder
  understanding and navigating through the code and again, to name conflicts.

Extensive monkey patching and ambivalence of our feelings about that is
also a part of "Rails is a blessing/curse for Ruby" paradox.

Ruby is oblidged to Rails with its current popularity, but also with
questionable reputation. Many of "Rails way" elements are associated with
"how they do it in Ruby" and "too much magic", including infamous "convention
over configuration" principle—and extensive monkey-patching if whatever Rails
team wants to "fix".

At first, people love that you can just write that `1.day.ago` and that's
look so expressive and readable... Then they became suspicious on reliability
and ubiquity of those little "convenience" tricks.

## OK, then why not refinements?..

Addressing "open classes are cool"/"monkey patching is dangerous" dychotomy,
Ruby 2 had introduced [refinements](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/doc/syntax/refinements_rdoc.html).

That seemed (and still seems to some, including me) just "right" amount
of compromise: you want to make some complicated code simple and readable,
you refine your scope with any `Integer#fancy_shmancy_method` you want,
but all other scopes stay unpolluted and everything seems under control.

Unfortunately, refinements happened to arrive half-baked, and since than,
trapped into negative feedback loop: nobody loves them, nobody uses them,
nobody cares about Ruby core team's attempts to improve them; but it's cool
and fashionable to write your own "why refinements are bad" article or
blog post. Most of those texts are true and useful (that's the
[most recent one](https://codequs.com/p/SJOz60SY/the-pros-and-cons-of-ruby-refinements/)
I saw), but I'm not sure that's the only reaction refinements deserve.

In addition, JRuby doesn't seem to support refinements decently, and,
as far as I know, doesn't even have plan to do that. So, if you are gem
or other open source project author, relying on refinements becames almost
as bad as relying on C extensions (or even worse, considering fact that
popular C extensions, like Nokogiri, eventually get their JRuby version
or analog... with refinements, you are just stuck).

## So, maybe we should just abandon and forbid them totally?..

But, wait. Open classes of Ruby is a great playground for experimenting,
finding the "right" ways and approaches. Our language is our tool, and,
most important, its _tool of thought_, not just of constructing stuff you
already know how to do. And openness of all and everything is good help
on the way to what's right and what will work.

RSpec, for one, is a great example of that (turn away for a moment,
MiniTest fans! anyways, in the next post we'll investigate that "MiniTest is
just Ruby" rant).

It's earlydays syntax

```ruby
(2 + 2).should == 4
```

was definitely "too invasive" to be reliable, but its descendant

```ruby
expect(2 + 2).to eq 4
```

is an excellent compromise: readable, flexible, extendable and way superior to
oldfashioned `assert_that_really_important_thing` (you are still turned
away, MiniTest fans!)

Important thing is, RSpec's brevity and readability changed the way of
"specs" perception, **and** I believe it could not be achieved without "all
is monkey-patched" step in progress. That's how great Ruby tools emerge
(and note that currently there is NO monkey patches RSpec requires), and
that's how the language itself evolves.

> Of course, the reasoning above may seem irrelevant to you, especially
  if for you, your programming language is rather hammer than tool of
  thought.

## When you are safe, and when you aren't

OK, so let's agree we will patch our monkeys until they would be really
tired! Yet we still need some safety rules to not became monkeys ourself.

Let's try to think of some:

* First of all: think if your patch could be replaced with inheritance?
  If, for example, you want your arrays to have ton of statistical methods,
  (while still being a decent array), maybe it is reasonable to just do

  ```ruby
  class StatisticalArray < Array
    def mean
      sum / count
    end
    #....
  end
  ```

* Then: whether your patch could be replaced with module included on-the-fly?

  ```ruby
  module Stats
    def mean
      sum / count
    end
  end

  # This is not much better than just patch the class directly:
  Array.include Stats

  # ...though, provides _some_ useful information:
  [1,2,3].method(:mean)
  # => #<Method: Array(Stats)#mean>

  # ...but, you can just modify one instance of array to have necessary
  # functionality:
  [1,2,3].extend(Stats).mean
  # => 2

  # Other array instance aren't polluted
  [4,5,6].mean
  # NoMethodError: undefined method `mean' for [4, 5, 6]:Array
  ```

* Than: selecting the name for your patch, try to use something
  unambiguous (e.g. `Fixnum#positive?`... though, is `0.positive?`);
* ...or something really specific to your project, like `String#to_our_company_logo`;
* ...or, at least, something rare and unlikely to clash with other's
  ideas (see "My favorite patch" below);
* Adding new behavior (like `Time#monday?`) is safer than changing existing
  one (like rewriting `Time#-`)—though the latter is often tempting,
  especially for infix math operators;
  * FYI: I break this rule myself in [reality](https://github.com/molybdenum-99/reality/blob/master/lib/reality/pretty_inspect.rb),
    providing better `#inspect` for some of stdlib classes... but it
    is optional and harmless (and proposed to be [fixed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12790)
    in Ruby itself);
* Using monkey-patching in home scripting and experiments is always safe,
  though, consider it like testing approaches, not acquiring habits (e.g.,
  don't tug your entire favorite `core_ext.rb` in your next commercial
  or OSS project);
* Using monkey-patching in gems you hope to be popular is almost always
  really bad decision, or at least requires serious consideration;
* Never (or at least try to never) use monkey patching in gems if it is only
  for internal needs of the gem! For example, while developing [daru](https://github.com/v0dro/daru)
  we eventually removed all `Array` extensions we needed for cleaner
  code inside, and [left only](https://github.com/v0dro/daru/blob/master/lib/daru/monkeys.rb)
  `Array#daru_vector` for converting native arrays to our types (which is
  also a good choice of specific yet short name);
  * Sometimes I break this rule too. See "My favorite patch" section for
    example and justification.
* Using monkey patches in applications is _moderately_ safe; you still
  could have pretty ugly name clashes (especially if using ActiveSupport,
  which you probably do); you still should consider good architecture
  (e.g. do not attach behavior to unrelated data) and overall readability
  and predictability... Like, you know, always and with any language
  features;
* It is _almost_ safe to use "backporting" monkey-patches, to use feature
  of newest versions of Ruby with older ones. There is excellent
  [backports](https://github.com/marcandre/backports) gem, but it is
  unfortunately [stale](https://github.com/marcandre/backports/issues/98)
  on version 2.1.0;
* Finally, if with monkey patch you fix or enchance some third party gem
  (fixing its classes, not core ones), consider providing a PR to gem's
  author instead, it is greatly appreciated by commynity!

## On patches collections

Many projects have gathered tons of useful monkey-patches into gems. Most
prominent are probably [ActiveSupport](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html)
of Rails and [Ruby Facets](https://github.com/rubyworks/facets).

I have a strong opinion (through my years with Ruby, I've developed a lot
of them) that grouping patches in gem are almost never helpful (OK, unless
ActiveSupport is a part of your _framework of choice_). Different "patches
packs" have different attitudes and semantics for lot of their features,
so, when you try to "have all the best (and nothing else)", you probably
end up with "just take ActiveSupport" (which is behemoth not suitable for
all kinds of projects), and loose all other possibilities.

So, once I've even tried to do "the right thing": community-driven
[list of copy-pasteable snippets](https://github.com/zverok/rubyseeds),
which you just pick for your own `core_ext.rb`.
Still don't know whether it is the right thing to do. And in fact, you
cad use any other "patches pack" gem's code as part of the "community
repository of patches" (I never depend on ActiveSupport, but frequently
steel from it).

## My favorite patch

There is one little thing, that I can't live without since I "invented"
it (and immediately found out that there are hundreds of previous
"inventors"), and even break some of "safety rules" described above.

It is infamous `yield self` trick ([one of first](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6721)
proposals in Ruby tracker, [latest discussion](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12760)).
It looks like entire community agree that "we need it, just can't name
it" (the latter link lists all the names people came up with so far...
like, 30 of them).

Why this is important and useful?

Imagine the code:

```ruby
response = MyHTTPLibrary.get('http://api.example.com/list.json')
parsed = JSON.parse(response.body)
count = parsed['count'] || parsed['meta']['count']
count.to_i
```

It is almost inevitable, but has several typical "smells", like short-living
variables and being imperative more than functional.

Now, imagine that:

```ruby
MyHTTPLibrary.get('http://api.example.com/list.json').body
  .some_method(&JSON.method(:parse))
  .some_method { |parsed| parsed['count'] || parsed['meta']['count'] }
  .to_i
```

Isn't it much better? (If your answer is "no", you can skip the rest of
the section, I will not be offended ;)).

For me, the code with `some_method` is 10x more clean and readable. It
is like [Elixir's pipes](http://culttt.com/2016/04/25/using-pipe-operator-elixir/),
but in most Rubyish way possible.

> And, as a side note, having this in language core seriously saves from
  monkey patches! E.g. why have `.to_json` attached to all core classes,
  when you can just use the following code and call it a day?

```ruby
['test', 'me'].some_method(&JSON.method(:generate))
```

The discussion for "better name" is lazily held since 2012 (can you imagine
that?..), but in the meantime I started to use it in my code, even in
gems.

What's about the name?.. My current favorite for Ruby core is `itself`
(which we already have, it just should take a block as an argument), but
redefining one of such a basic things in a gem code is unforgivable sin.

So, I just stick to a name `derp`: it is short, resembles `tap` and
dumb enough to avoid name clashes in the most of code.

You can find this kind of code everywhere in my gems:

```ruby
make_query(selectors)
  .derp { |query| http_client.get(query, format: :json) }
  .derp { |res| Wikidata::Entity.from_sparql(res.body) }
```

## One-line conclusion

Monkey patches are useful, questionable and need to be mastered by any
professional rubyist.

That's, basically, it.

And use your head and taste constantly.
