Now, here is the idea of RSpec: using methods-with-blocks and small self-sufficient objects, to write _only what's necesary_ in expressive manner. Like this:

```ruby
subject { 2 + other }

context 'with numerics' do
  let(:other) { 3 }
  it { is_expected.to eq(5) }
#...
```

The "DSL" has surprising low numer of building blocks, and the most powerful ones are perfectly in line with Ruby's qualities: small matchers objects (`eq(5)`), with new custom ones being easily produced, methods-with-blocks allowing to structure names, descriptions, and examples in a regular way. The best thing about the system it is fully hackable and discoverable: methods like `it` and `let` defined in predictable places and have predictable calling context, allowing natural mix with "just Ruby":

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4].each do |test_value|
  context "when rendered with #{test_value}" do
    let(:value) { test_value }
    it { is_expected.to .... }
  end
end
```

Now, the basic idea of MiniTest is this (quoted from its README):

```ruby
class TestMeme < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    @meme = Meme.new
  end

  def test_that_kitty_can_eat
    assert_equal "OHAI!", @meme.i_can_has_cheezburger?
  end
```

Looks familiar? It definitely should! MiniTest follows the well-known design of "XUnit" library, looking mostly the same in... every mainstream language. So, yeah, yay for "mainstream quasilanguage" approach, which nowadays considered "more Rubyish" (till you make a typo in `test_` prefix, or try to hack into assertion system).

> The interesting nuance of this story is that current RSpec maintainers seem to befall under "let's don't do magic" spell themselves. Currently encouraged styleâ€”by most of modern guides, excluding some features like `its()` API and linters seems (to me!) to going against the "spirit" of RSpec, with one-line write-as-much-as necessary approach. Some time ago I covered those topics in more detail in a pair of blog-posts: [on MiniTest/RSpec](https://zverok.github.io/blog/2016-10-09-minitest.html) and on [tests expressivenes](https://zverok.github.io/blog/2017-11-07-on-culture-of-bdd.html).

For the

>>>>>> This fact frequently plays _against_ the changes importanse in public opinion, like "yawn, they've just added some more methods... language bloated ALREADY!" (Oh, and when the change _is_ the syntax one, like beginless/endless ranges, it is met with equal disgust "now they not only adding methods, but changed the syntax! WHY?")
