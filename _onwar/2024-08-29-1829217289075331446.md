A year ago, another of my brothers-in-arms from the officer courses group was killed on the battlefield.
His name was Ihor Honchar, and he actually died on Aug 27, but we were initially told that he had been MIA since Aug 29. Only three weeks later, his body was recovered.

He was one of the oldest in my training squad, some 34 or 35 years, and one from my closest circle. Very calm and reasonable man, chief engineer on some plant before army.

We talked a lot while on training, but all about everyday things, so I donâ€™t have a lot of stories about him.
He also has a very typical name for Ukrainian, so it is hard to find any additional info.

He was patient and persistent in training, had all the high marks. Handy with practical tasks. Funny. Patriotic. Tough when necessary.

Rest in glory, my friend.
